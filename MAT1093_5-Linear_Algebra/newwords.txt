 We can even predict that l should
vary (inversely) as the square of the molecular diameter because the cross section of a molecule—not its diameter—determines its effective target area

you can find stationary points by taking the gradient and setting it to 0. i won't show it, but this problem is convex (the hessiam is symmetric positive semidefinite), meaning that if we find one local minimizer, it is global (but not necessarily unique)
